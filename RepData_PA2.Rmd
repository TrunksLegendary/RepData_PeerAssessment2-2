#Synopsis

Immediately after the title, there should be a synopsis which describes and summarizes your analysis in at most 10 complete sentences.


#Data Processing



```{r, cache=TRUE}
options(stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
#
# you should change path according to your system
setwd("c:/Users/gregory/Documents/!Projects/Trainings/Coursera - Reproducible Research/RepData_PA2/")
# download.file(url = "http://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2",destfile = "stormdata.csv.bz2")

storm = read.csv("stormdata.csv.bz2",header=TRUE)

```

```{r}
str(storm)


summary(storm)
summary(storm)


```



You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
